# Tengacion — The Social OS for the Next Billion People
Tengacion is a next-generation social platform that merges
real-time communication, creator monetization, AI-driven discovery,
and community ownership into one seamless digital ecosystem.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, Tengacionis built as a
modular, open, and intelligence-driven social operating system.

## Core Principles
- People own their audience
- Creators own their monetization
- AI serves users, not advertisers
- Communities govern themselves

## Architecture

- frontend/ → Web experience
- backend/ → API, auth, social graph
- mobile/ → iOS & Android apps
- ai/ → Feed ranking, moderation, discovery
- infra/ → Cloud, scaling, deployment
- docs/ → Specs, RFCs, vision

## Status
