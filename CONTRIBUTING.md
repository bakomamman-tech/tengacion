# Contributing to Smoothie
We welcome engineers, designers, AI researchers, and builders
who want to help create the future of social platforms.

## Repository Structure

Smoothie is organized into independent systems:

- frontend/ → Web client
- backend/ → API & social graph
- mobile/ → iOS / Android
- ai/ → recommendation & moderation
- infra/ → cloud, scaling & CI/CD

Please work only inside the folder relevant to your task.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
3. Make your changes
4. Commit clearly
   git commit -m "Add: user story reactions"
5. Push your branch
6. Open a Pull Request

## Rules

- Do not push directly to `main`
- One feature per branch
- Code must not break existing builds
- Keep commits small and meaningful

## Our Culture

We build Smoothie with:
- Respect
- Clean code
- Long-term thinking
- User-first design

If you’re here, you’re part of the mission.
