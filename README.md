### The Social OS for the Next Billion People

Tengacion is a next-generation social platform designed as a **Social Operating System** — not just another social network.

It combines real-time communication, creator monetization, AI-driven discovery, and community governance into one unified, modular ecosystem.

Unlike traditional platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, **Tengacion is built to be open, extensible, and intelligence-driven**, where users and creators retain ownership and control.

- **Creators own their monetization**  
  Direct value exchange without exploitative intermediaries.

- **Communities govern themselves**
